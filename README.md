📰 Real and Fake News Analysis - README

📌 Project Title:
Real and Fake News Analysis using Machine Learning

✅ Project Description:
This project aims to classify news articles as either real or fake using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a reliable model that can accurately distinguish between genuine news and false information.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For visualizations
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning models
NLTK, re: For natural language processing and text cleaning
Jupyter Notebook / IDE: Google Colab, Jupyter, or VS Code

📊 Dataset Description:
Source: The dataset contains labeled news articles categorized as real or fake.

Columns:
title: The headline of the article
text: The body content of the article
label: The class label (1 = Real, 0 = Fake)

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Text Preprocessing:
Removing punctuations, special characters, and stopwords
Converting text to lowercase
Tokenization and lemmatization

Data Visualization:
Word cloud visualization for fake and real news
Distribution of fake and real articles
Top words and bigrams in each category

🛠️ Model Building Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Removing null values and duplicates
Tokenizing and cleaning the text

Feature Extraction:
Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features

Model Training and Evaluation:
Models used:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score

Model Selection:
The best-performing model based on accuracy and F1-score is selected for final prediction.

📈 Results & Insights:
The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy with 94.2%, followed by SVM with 92.8%.

Key Findings:
Fake news tends to use sensational language and emotionally charged words.
Real news articles contain more neutral and formal language.
Models using TF-IDF with Logistic Regression performed well due to the effectiveness of this vectorization technique.

⚠️ Challenges Faced:
Data Imbalance: Some datasets may have imbalanced classes, affecting the model’s performance.

Text Cleaning Complexity: Removing irrelevant content without losing the context was a challenge.
Overfitting: Some models overfitted on training data due to high complexity.

🔥 Future Improvements:
Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.
Incorporate real-time news scraping and classification.
Enhance sentiment analysis to understand emotional tones.
